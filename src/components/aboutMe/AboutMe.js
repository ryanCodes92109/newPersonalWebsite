              Hi! I'm Ryan, and i am a Fullstack Engineer. I've made a huge change in my life and decided to learn some new skills that would allow me to expand more personally and professionally. I'm an ex-Technical Recruiter with companies like Google, Zillow and Rivian, but finally had the chance to pursue a different career path after 10 years. 
            </p>
            <p>
              I completed the Flatiron School Fullstack Engineering program in 2023 and really enjoyed building my <strong>projects</strong> while getting a strong grasp on Javascript, React and Ruby/Rails.     I really enjoyed working closely with the Frontend of my app specifically and really hope I get the chance to utilize my creativity and enhance my UI skills!
            </p>
            <p>
              Feel free to <strong>contact</strong> me if I may be a good fit for any open positions you know of! In the meantime, here are a bunch of pictures of my dogs.
